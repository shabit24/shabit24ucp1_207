          <h2>Programming Knowledge</h2>
          <p>With a strong foundation in programming, I dedicate time each morning to enhance my skills and stay updated with the latest technologies. Before starting my workday, I allocate 30 minutes to coding exercises, where I solve programming challenges or work on personal projects.</p>
          <p>This deliberate practice not only sharpens my problem-solving abilities but also expands my knowledge in programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, and HTML/CSS. Additionally, I allocate time to read articles, watch tutorials, or participate in online coding communities to stay informed about industry trends and best practices.</p>
          <p>By incorporating programming into my morning routine, I continuously strive to improve my skills and pursue my passion for technology. This proactive approach sets a positive tone for the rest of the day and fuels my creativity and productivity in both professional and personal endeavors.</p>
