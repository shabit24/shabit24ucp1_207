          <h2>Morning Routine</h2>
          <p>I wake up at 4:30 AM, feeling refreshed and ready to start the day. After stretching and taking a few deep breaths, I head to the kitchen to prepare a cup of hot water with lemon to kickstart my metabolism and hydrate my body.</p>
          <p>Following that, I spend a few minutes journaling, reflecting on the previous day, and setting intentions for the day ahead. This helps me clear my mind and focus on my goals.</p>
          <p>At around 5:15 AM, I engage in a brief meditation session to center myself and cultivate a sense of calmness and mindfulness. This practice helps me stay grounded throughout the day.</p>
          <p>By 5:45 AM, I'm ready to tackle my morning workout. Whether it's a brisk walk, yoga session, or strength training at the gym, I prioritize physical activity to energize my body and boost my mood.</p>
          <p>After completing my workout, I take a refreshing shower to rejuvenate my senses and prepare for the day ahead. By 7:00 AM, I'm dressed and ready to enjoy a nutritious breakfast before diving into my work or other activities.</p>
